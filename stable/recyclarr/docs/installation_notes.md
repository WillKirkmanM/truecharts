To edit recyclarr's files in the /config dir, I highly recommend using the codeserver Addon-on. It offers a web based file editor. Its meant to be temporarily so you can add/remove it any time.

Checkout upstream docs for the latest info on its configuration [here](https://recyclarr.dev/wiki/cli/main/).
