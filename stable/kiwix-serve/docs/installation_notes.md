You need to have at least one `.zim` file.

You can download a `.zim` file from [here](https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Content)

## ZIM Files

For 1 `.zim` file:

- Enter the download link in the `DOWNLOAD` field box. You have to remove the link afterwards,
  otherwise it will keep re-downloading the file on each start.

For 1 or more `.zim` files:

- Mount `Data Storage` to a Host Path, and place your `.zim` files there.
