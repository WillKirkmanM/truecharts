title: Installation Notes

- Set `Plex Token` to your plex token, info [here](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

- Optionally Set `Streamable Login` and `Streamable Password` to your account details.

- Set `Plex URL` to the url of plex, typically you can use:

  - `http://plex.ix-plex.svc.cluster.local:32400`
  - `http://IP:32400`
  - `https://plex.mydomain.tld`

- In order for this to work you will need to add your media through additional storage and mount the same internal dir that you used in plex.
  - ex: `/media`
