title: Changing Database Password
---

Out-Of-The-Box, vaultwarden supports changing the database password automatically.
However, if you ever saved any settings in the admin UI, this might not be correctly overridden automatically.

In these cases you'll have to manually alter the configurationfile of Vaultwarden yourself.

We consider this out-of-scope for support, as it involves running configs that are made outside of the Helm chart we offer.
