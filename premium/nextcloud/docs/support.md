title: NextCloud Support Policy
---

Our support is only covering pre-included Nextcloud apps. We cannot guarantee user-added apps will work or survive updates

We can also only support one "layout" or config.php setup (so no multisite) config.php should be considered non-user alterable. Users should write custom config files to append/override config.php instead.
Custom user config files are, however, not covered by our support either.

Users are expected to know how to troubleshoot database issues with Nextcloud.
If you need support for Nextcloud itself, please consider a support contract from Nextcloud or a hosted Nextcloud instance instead.
